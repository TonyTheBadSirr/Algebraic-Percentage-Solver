# Algebraic-Percentage-Solver
This is a simple algebraic formula made for the convenience finding the percent increase/decrease of what ever two numbers you enter. The idea is to use Java's IntelliJ IDEA program and features to enter in a starting number and a final number and the program is set to do the math for you to find the percentage change between the two.
